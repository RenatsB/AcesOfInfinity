# AcesOfInfinity
A 3D space shooter game
(University project)
---------------------
This game is my attempt to create something similar to "Elite", a video game back from 80s.
---------------------
```
The game includes:
  A simple menu
  3 types of ships
  Ship AI based on states
  Player controlled ship
  Random space sector generation
  A name generator for the sector
  2 types of rendering (solid and wireframe)
  
Note:In current version (0.9) text rendering is also implemented but still requires some editing
```
