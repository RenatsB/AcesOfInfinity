# AcesOfInfinity v0.9
A 3D space shooter game
(University project)
-----------------------
This game is my attempt to create something similar to "Elite", a video game back from 80s.
\nThe game includes:
\n  A simple menu
\n  3 types of ships
\n  Ship AI based on states
\n  Player controlled ship
\n  Random space sector generation
\n  A name generator for the sector
\n  2 types of rendering (solid and wireframe)
------------------------
\nNote:In current version (0.9) text rendering is also implemented but still requires some editing
\nNote:Further updates will follow
